                                Extreme weather events can be a crucial factor that adversely impacts traffic volumes.

                                better understanding of weather factors affecting traffic flow can eventually help both

                    <p class="h5">
                        To have a better understanding of the impact of extreme climate events on
                        traffic volume in Atlanta, this research mainly focused on analyzing and examining
                        the following research questions:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Does precipitation, temperature, visibility and wind speed as
                            extreme events
                            have a significant impact on hourly traffic volume in Atlanta?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If so, does the impact have a specific pattern? Is the impact different based on
                            different times of the day and volumes of precipitation, temperature, visibility
                            and wind speed?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Is it possible to statistically correlate these impacts?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Is it possible to develop a machine learning model that can account for interdependent
                            weather variables and predict impacts on hourly traffic volume?
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="h5">
                        For the purpose of answering these research questions, this study analyzed and
                        examined the impact of weather events on hourly traffic volume. These data came
                        from 48 permanent traffic counter sites and was analyzed by applying statistical
                        techniques to study correlation and machine learning models to predict traffic volume
                        impacts under extreme weather events.

                    <p class="h5">
                        This research generally focuses on the Atlanta Metropolitan Statistical Area
                        (MSA), which is one of the most important business capitals of the southern U.S.
                        With more than 5,000,000 population, the city is one of the busiest in terms of activities
                        and transportation. According to the Georgia Department of Revenue Motor
                        Vehicle Division Registration, there are almost 3,000,000 personal passenger cars in
                        the area, and more than 500,000 daily ridership. Moreover, Atlanta received an average
                        annual rainfall of 49.71 inches (1263 millimeters) which is 27% more than the average in
                        other similarly sized US cities (NOAA). This is the perfect combination of
                        these two variables, thereby making Atlanta the best candidate for this research.

                        <li>
                            Hourly Weather Data <br>
                            Weather data used in this analysis were collected from 4 climate stations retrieved from
                            the Integrated Surface Hourly (ISH) weather data archives of the National Centers of
                            Environmental Information (NCEI). This analysis retrieved almost 225,000 records
                            of hourly weather observations spanning the time period, 2011 - 2015. These data
                            were then converted from UTC timezone to Atlanta’s local timezone which is the
                            Eastern Time Zone, while implementing daylight savings time. One major problem was that
                            the data were collected at isolated observation sites, which were used to capture
                            temperature, wind speed, visibility and precipitation data at the traffic observation
                            sites. This research uses spatial interpolation techniques such as Inverse Distance
                            Weighting (IDW), Kriging and radial basis function (RBF) to estimate the weather
                            variables geographically.

                            Hourly traffic variables <br>
                            This research was conducted using hourly traffic data recorded by 48 Automatic
                            Traffic Recorder (ATR) sites for the 5-year period from 2011 - 2015. The ATR
                            stations were permanently installed on the Road Inventory network to count the
                            number of all vehicles passing through each counter location on State Routes, major
                            county roads, and major city streets continuously 7 days a week, 24 hours a day,
                            365 days a year. This traffic dataset consisted of latitude and longitude of the sites,
                            names of the roads where each camera was located, amount of hourly traffic volume,
                            and datestamp that the camera recorded the traffic volume. This research collected
                            traffic data through a web-based GIS from Transmetric LLC company and stored it
                            in a local PostgreSQL database.

                            Correlation Analysis <br>
                            This research applied three statistical test including Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney, and
                            T-test in R programming by the same procedure as follows: every statistical comparison
                            analysis was used to compare traffic volume in normal weather conditions and extreme
                            weather conditions. Each model separately analyzed traffic volume from each weather
                            variable, station, and hour of day. It is important to realize, for some cases, numbers
                            of base cases outnumbered extreme cases more than five times. To avoid issues from
                            different sample sizes, this research applied a bootstrapping technique by randomly
                            picking equal numbers of extreme case records and base case records and recreated the
                            t-test model 100 times. The p-values were sorted in ascending order. Then, p-values at
                            the 80 percentile was chosen to be a representative of the group. If more than 80% of
                            the results fell under 0.05, it was understood that there was a significant difference
                            between the means of the extreme and base case groups. The total of 1,152 p-values from
                            the comparison between traffic volume from every traffic station (48) and every hour of
                            day (24) were stored in a table.<br>

                            This research used a decision learning tree method to investigate the impact
                            of extreme weather events on traffic volume because it allowed all of the independent
                            variables to be considered at the same time and did not assume an underlying
                            distribution. Decision tree learning was one of the most widely used predictive machine
                            learning techniques. This method was a non-parametric supervised statistical
                            method for classification and regression. The purpose of this model was to predict
                            values of a target variable by producing tree structures.

                        The visualization platform was developed to visually encode the results of this traffic behavior

                        and conduct a user research to expand its potential. This app was built just to show the
                        results the research without considering possible potentials that it could help users
                        such as urban planner, commuters, and others who might get benefits from this
                        information. We might be able to develop a better decision support tool and
                        visualization that can support multiple uses and provide better information to groups of
                        users.
