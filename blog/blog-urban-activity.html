                        I created a series of maps to observe travel pattern of people
                        from different income and race groups. I used a black base map to show contrast of area
                        and spatial acitivities.

                    <p class="h5">
                        I used different color to visualize different activities, such as
                        traveling to work, going to hospital, shopping, etc.

                        like
                        to encode multivariate information in terms of how busy that place is, what kind of
                        activities that people are doing at that place, and the location of that place. So, I
                        used points to indicate the location of the place, color to differentiate the
                        activities, and size to show how much people go to visit the site in a day.

                    <h4>Data Processing</h4>
                    <p class="h5">
                        I downloaded the raw survey data in MS Access. Then I reorganized and converted data into
                        Postgres
                        Database. The dataset is categorized into two different subgroups by ethnicity and
                        socio-economic
                        status. In this research, the ethnicity is divided into four groups of races which are White,
                        African
                        American, Asian and Hispanic. For Socio-economic status analysis, this subgroup is categorized
                        into
                        seven subgroups based on median household income including<br>
                        1 - Less than $20,000<br>
                        2 - $20,000 to $34,999<br>
                        3 - $35,000 to $49,999<br>
                        4 - $50,000 to $59,999<br>
                        5 - $60,000 to $74,999<br>
                        6 - $75,000 to $99,999<br>
                        7 - More than $100,000<br>
                        In order to calculate travel time for each trip, we have to generate the pairs of x,y coordinate
                        between
                        household locations as the origins and the travel destinations and mode of transportation in
                        order
                        to
                        calculate the travel time of each trip. After data was fetching from the database, it will be
                        computed
                        through Google Distance Matrix API in order to get the travel time based on geographical
                        coordinates
                        and
                        mode of transportation.

                    <h4>Data Analysis</h4>
                    <p class="h5">
                        In order to study the different in travel patterns for four activities
                        including routine
                        shopping, restaurant dining,
                        primary care and recreational activities among subpopulations.
                        First, we have to find the fitness distance decay functions that
                        can help us address the changes or declination in the interaction effect
                        between physical or socioeconomic objects decline with distance between them.
                        <br><br>
                        For this research, five distance-decay functions ,including Gaussian, Power,
                        Exponential,
                        Polynomial and Logarithm, are used to model the travel pattern of each subgroup
                        and compared with one another. The model with the highest pseudo-R2 is will be selected
                        as the best fitting model. All the parameters are estimated using the non-linear
                        least squares estimator. For more information about distance decay effect can be found
                        at

                        As a result, The Gaussian function persistently produced large pseudo-R2 than Power,
                        Exponential, Polynomial and Logarithm acrid all population subgroups.
                        This function is expressed as:

                    <h4>Results</h4>
                    <p class="h5">
                        After analyzing results of all subgroup travel patterns with Gaussian function, the results
                        we got from each subgroup based on distance decay effects (ÃŸ) are as the following.
                        For ethnicity analysis, the travel time that each ethnic spend for their trips various from
                        activities. To illustrate this, Asian spent more travel time on dining. African American
                        spent more time on shopping and health care, while Hispanic tended to focus on recreation.
                        Moreover, Asian got the highest distance decay effect among four activities.
                        <br>
                        For income analysis, the travel time that each income spend for their trips are also
                        various. However, people whose had the lowest income spent more travel time on Health Care
                        and Shopping, and the highest income spend more time for relaxing activities such as
                        recreation and dining. These two sub-income groups also had the highest distance decay
                        effect for most of activities.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Do not assume where would people go for their trips especially
                            for shopping.
                            I thought people would
                            go to downtown or big mall for shopping. There were a lot of reversing commuters that
                            people who
                            lived in
                            the cities went to shop and eat in suburban areas.
                        </li>
                        <li> Due to a small number of records for some subpopulation groups,
                            the distance
                            decay factors for
                            those groups might not be sufficient to reflect their actual travel patterns.
